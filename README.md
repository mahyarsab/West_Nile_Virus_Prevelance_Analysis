West Nile Virus (WNV) is a viral illness largely spread by mosquitoes. The disease is transmitted to a person when an infected mosquito bites them.

The city of Chicago, Illinois has been keeping track of mosquito populations and WNV prevalence using a series of traps that they place around the city. They are then able to study the captured specimens and monitor the state of WNV spread in the city.

Mosquito tracking dataset from 2008 to 2019 is given [here](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=159teLRYzRf8tbAUwlKZw_W68MGsn8gfR).

In part 1, I will perform EDA and data wrangling to get familiar with the dataset from the city of Chicago.

Refer to the table below for details about the data:

In part 2, I will move on to a set of analyses on the relationship between the different variables and the mosquito number, as well as the probability of finding West Nile Virus (WNV) at any particular time and location using Advanced Statistical Analysis like Linear and Logistic Regression.




For this part, you must use the provided cleaned dataset which differs from that for Part 1. [Download the data here](https://api.brainstation.io/content/link/1OlcA7a7d0KXPMpFEZdjcgiNwqBsPEVPl).
